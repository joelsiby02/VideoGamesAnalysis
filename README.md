# 🎮 Video Game Sales Analysis (Excel)

This project is a data exploration and visualization task done entirely using **Microsoft Excel**, aimed at understanding the trends and performance of video game sales over time.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Dataset Used:** Global video game sales dataset (1977–2016)
- **Tool:** Microsoft Excel
- **Objective:** Analyze yearly trends in game releases and global sales, and visualize insights using charts and pivot tables.

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

- Counted the **number of games released per year**
- Summed up **global sales per year**
- Created a **Pivot Table** to analyze:
  - Rows: `Year`
  - Values: `Count of Name`, `Sum of Global Sales`
- Created a **Combo Chart** to visualize:
  - Column: Number of games
  - Line: Total global sales
  - Used **secondary axis** for clear comparison

## 📈 Insights

- Years like **1983–1989** had **fewer games**, but **relatively high global sales**.
- A strong upward trend was seen in the **2000s**, with a surge in both the **number of games released** and **total global sales**.
- The combo chart provided a powerful way to compare **volume vs. revenue**.

- Pivot Table creation and filtering
- Charting using:
  - Line charts
  - Combo charts with dual axes
- Extracting insights from visual trends


## 🚀 Next Steps

I’ll be moving on to learn **Power BI**, and eventually building interactive dashboards using real-world datasets. This project lays the groundwork for business-level reporting and data visualization.
